# python_adventure_game

Welcome our adventure game! This is a placeholder README for right now, but we are intending to create a text-based adventure game where you role-play a character and simulate a DnD campaign, complete with stats, chance, items, and enemies! If you've never played Dungeons & Dragons, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO2qv5Uin9c has a simple explanation of the basic mechanics and gameplay. We will be looking to emulate this in a python command line environment.

# * 1) Download code
# * 2) From CLI, CD into "python_adventure_game" directory
# * 3) From CLI, run [ python3 forest.py ]
